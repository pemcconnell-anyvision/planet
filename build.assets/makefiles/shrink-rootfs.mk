# This makefile runs right after an image was created
# Its purpose is to remove as much garbage out of $(ROOTFS) as possible

# Units to disable:
#
# Disable cgproxy as there might not be a cgmanager running on host
# Disable cgmanager as it only runs outside of container
#
# Disable apt upgrade services
#
# Disable lvm2 metadata daemon/socket and monitor
# Disable block availability service (blk-availability.service) to avoid deactivation
# of block devices on container stop
